# Learning SQL With MariaDB
This is me messing around with MariaDB in TypeScript trying to figure it out :)


I have a problem where HeidiSQL connects easily to a server on localhost but not nodejs so It's very annoying :/

### TODO / IDEAS
 - [ ] Add useful links for people that visit this repo
 - [ ] Include .sql files to setup the database I mess around in.
   -  For example the `CREATE USER` and `CREATE TABLE` code.
